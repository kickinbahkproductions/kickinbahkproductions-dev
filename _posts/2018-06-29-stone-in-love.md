I donâ€™t know about you, but I rarely go back and listen to music from past phases of my life. When I get the itch, I am often reminded how much I enjoy those songs. Recently this has been a not-as-popular Journey song called, Stone in Love. 

I figured we would take a break from talking about trust and just enjoy some great music: [Stone on Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=944wGt77Br4)

Happy Friday!
