When you utilize the Opening Act strategy, you are giving your content away for free. You are making a trade with your someone who has an audience to ‘borrow’ them and in turn provide free content. 

Creating content for free does take time, which is why it is important to know where your customers are. This way you are getting the most bang for your buck!

Onward and Upward,
