<p>The number 1 reason people don’t buy from ecommerce stores is that they want to be able to see the thing they are buying before they purchase it. The obvious item is clothing or shoes, but for me this extended to musical instruments too and furniture. </p>

<p>Many ecommerce stores have figured out ways to get around this concern from customers. The simplest way is to have a great return policy, but many companies, like Stitch-Fix and Indochino, have created an interesting customer onboarding to increase the likelihood the customer will love what they are purchasing.</p>

<p>There are additional ways around this customer fear for ecommerce stores, but since we are talking about why people might not buy from Amazon, we won’t go into those today.</p>

<p>Onward and Upward, </p>
