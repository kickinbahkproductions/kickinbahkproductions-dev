I love this article on [Aiming for 100 Rejections a Year](https://lithub.com/why-you-should-aim-for-100-rejections-a-year/) to make sure you keep growing and challenging yourself. 

This quote in particular resonates with me: 

_“Since I’ve started aiming for rejections, not acceptances, I no longer dread submitting. I don’t flinch (much) when I receive inevitable form rejection emails. Instead of tucking my story or essay apologetically into a bottle and desperately casting it out to sea, I launch determined air raids of submission grenades, five or ten at a time. I wait for the rejections, line up my next tier of journals, and submit again.”_

Half the battle is showing up and being persistent. Aim for rejections. I have some theories on why we don’t like to be rejected too. My goal is if I know why I am afraid of being rejected, I can overcome the fear long enough to do what I need to do.
