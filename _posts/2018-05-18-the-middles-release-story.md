I have been listening to this song non-stop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3mJkSqZbX4

The first time I heard the song was in a Target commercial. 

Interestingly, the music video for The Middle was premiered at the Grammys, in conjunction with Target. If you watch the music video it has a lot of Target brand elements; the kids dancing, the black and white rings, ect.

Some of what I love about this is the marriage between capitalism and creativity. The song wasn’t written for Target per se, yet before it really had become popular commercials started running with this great song.

Collaborations for the benefit of both the creator and commerce can be beneficial and create a unique and valuable experience for customers. We already do some of this in Ecommerce by creating content and looking for influencers, but I think there is more exploration to be had in the relationship between two fields that couldn’t seem further apart.

Discovering unique ways to pair your product and store message with interesting and creative marketing opportunities start with knowing your customers, what they consume, and where they are. The easiest way to find this out is to interview them.
