The keynote address for Shopify’s partner conference Unite was yesterday morning. If you weren’t like me…rubbing the sleep out of my eyes with a cup of coffee to tune in at _7 am_ to see what’s new, you can rewatch it here: [https://unite.shopify.com/livestream](https://unite.shopify.com/livestream)

There were a lot of new features for store owners. I think the most interesting new feature to me was the Localization of currency. There have been apps to do this previously, but having this built right into your store is brilliant. Along with this localization is an optimization of the payment methods typical for a specific region. For example, in China most payments are done via AliPay or WeChat. The said these methods would be shown based on what is typical for the shopper’s region. 

I don’t think anyone would disagree that payment is paramount so seeing enhancements like this being built into the checkout experience means store owners can focus more on getting customers to actually checkout be creating great copy and call to actions and not worry about the final steps of a customer paying .

Did you watch Unite? If so, let me know what you thought and your favorite feature announced.

Onward and Upward!
