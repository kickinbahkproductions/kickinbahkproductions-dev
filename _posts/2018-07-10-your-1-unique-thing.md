<p>Ever been in a tourist area? You walk in to each store and 99% of them have all the same stuff. That weird stuffed elephant toy, hats with the area on them and seemingly all the types of shirts you can think of….other than one you would actually wear!</p>

<p>This is basically how I felt walking into every store in Kauai. 99% of the store was basically all the same trinkets. However, it seemed each always had 1 or 2 things I hadn’t seen anywhere else. Were those few things what I was looking for? Not always. But if it was, I would get that unique thing I liked AND would get any of the other trinkets I wanted to for other people as well. </p>

<p>By having the 1 unique item, they were able to sell it and several non-unique things to me too. If you can find what makes you unique, lean into it and you’ll draw customers who resonate with it and take the other conveniences you offer too.</p>

<p>Onward and Upward, </p>
