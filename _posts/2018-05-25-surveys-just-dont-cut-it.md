_”Tell us how we are doing by going to www.surveyforfreestuff.com “._

We get these surveys from big companies all the time. Yeah I ignore them too. 
 
YOUR advantage as ecommerce store is you can be more personal than a cold and distant survey and you can get WAY more information doing it.

Just like Joey Gallo’s year so far, here are 3 things surveys completely whiff on:

1. There is very little incentive to fill out a survey. 
	People are much more likely to hop on a call with a person for 15 minutes than spend 15 minutes to fill out a survey.

2. Surveys don’t help you understand your customers.
	By nature, surveys are a ‘catch-all’. It is sent to every customer and misses the context of who your customer actually is.

3. Unbiased questions are challenging to make.
	If you are not careful with the questions you ask, you can easily steer the conversation to get the responses you want, rather than letting a conversation flow and discovering more about your customers.

Interviewing your customers, particularly your BEST customers is a huge advantage to being a lean, ecommerce store. Leverage this advantage you have over the Amazons and Targets of the world.
