I am sure there are more perspectives on change than just the ones I have laid out the last couple days. The real lesson is to know how you feel about change, particularly change for your business, and know the ‘weaknesses’ or blind spots it has. 

This way, when you look to explore making shifts to key parts of your business you have looked at the change you are making from both your perspective and put yourself in a different mindset to analyze as many parts to the change as possible. 

This also helps when things don’t go perfectly to start off or when the change is questioned. You have thought about why the change was needed, what possibilities or issues might come up and why you chose to change despite those. 

Change will come. Better to be instigating it than reacting to it. 

Onward and Upward!
