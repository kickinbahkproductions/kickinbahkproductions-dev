<p>There were 4 reasons I personally would consider buying from someone else besides Amazon. To Recap, here they are again: </p>

<ul>
	<li>I want more expertise from the company I am purchasing from.</li>
	<li>I wasn’t looking for the product, but was recommended it (from a blog post, ect) and will go straight from the link to where I saw it. </li>
	<li>I am a fan of the person selling the product and I know buying from them directly is better than going through Amazon.</li>
	<li>I am worried about fit or seeing/working with the physical product before buying (typically in cases of clothes, shoes and things like furniture or musical instruments).</li>
</ul>

<p>In last Thursday’s email, we talked about needing more expertise. Today, let’s talk a little about finding out about the product from someone else. </p>

<p>We are hit with ads seemingly every day of our lives. So much so, that we often barely seem to notice. And just in case they get a bit too much, we have the ability to fast-forward through them or block them altogether. </p>

<p>But, there is one place I don’t fast-forward ads….Podcasts. I listen to a lot of podcasts. I think in the average week, I listen to about 18 different shows, give or take. Most have ads or sponsorships of some sort. In my experience, these ads have been the most effective to me. Why? Because, someone I like and associate with is vouching for a product. Usually, the host will also include some reason they personally like the product, use it on a regular basis, and how it helps them. </p>

<p>You can see similar effectiveness from YouTube videos and blog posts. People buy from people. And if you are the one telling them how awesome something is in the midst of them getting other valuable content, people are more likely to listen and buy from you without shopping around. After all, they weren’t looking for it before you told them how awesome it was, right? </p>

<p>Onward and Upward!</p>
