When you think about it, trust is really fascinating. It plays out in almost every part of our life. Every relationship we have is based on some form of trust. The stronger the relationship, and I would also argue the more fruitful the relationship, is almost purely based on the amount of trust between the 2 parties.

Trust is comes down to an unspoken contract between two groups. 

Take a minute and think about  the trust you have with different people and companies in your life. I will be talking about the trust we have with companies over the next couple days. 

Have a great week!
