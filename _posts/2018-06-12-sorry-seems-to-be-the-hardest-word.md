You know that song, _“Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word”_? I first heard it as a [duet with Ray Charles and Elton John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y29dWcuqQY). It always made me laugh…how could one word be any harder to say than another word? It messed with my logical brain. 

If sorry is the hardest word to _say_, ‘no’ must be the hardest word to _hear_. People really don’t like to hear no or really any type of rejection. Naturally, we will avoid situations where we might be rejected. 

We almost have to consciously put ourselves in places to take risks and be rejected. More on that tomorrow…

Onward, Upward and Rejected ;),
