<p>My last week was spent on vacation. My wife and I spent a week in Kauai, Hawaii. You may have not noticed, cuz of of my email providerâ€™s awesome scheduling option, but it was a much needed break. </p>

<p>Make sure to take a little time away from your business and refresh. It is important and can bring new perspective to goals and needs for your store. </p>

<p>Here is a picture of my wife and I with Waimea Canyon in the background: </p>
