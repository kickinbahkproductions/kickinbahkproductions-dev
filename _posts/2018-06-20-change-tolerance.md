We have different levels of tolerance to change. I was reminded of this as my wife and I went to move this last week. We both have different tolerance to that change. 

Me? I enjoy change and exploring new opportunities. I know there is always unknowns, but as long as it is moving in a direction that seems like forward progress, I’ll do it. 

What I have to be careful about is change for the sake of change. If I don’t consistently measure results, I can get into a place where I am spinning different wheels, but not going anywhere. 

Tomorrow I’ll talk about my wife’s approach to change.
