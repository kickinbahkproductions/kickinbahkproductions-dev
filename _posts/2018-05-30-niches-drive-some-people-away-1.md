When I talk about having a niche, I often hear someone say, “But I don’t want to drive anyone away”. 

I would say this is a misunderstanding of how a niche works for you. 

One way it helps is a niche gives you insight into whether or not someone would actually buy from you. Rather than just throwing up facebook ads and hoping they click, then like what they see on your store, you can begin to adjust your brand, copy product descriptions, articles and emails to connect with a type of person who cares about \_\_\_\_\_ and solving that problem in their life.

This can be even more powerful if you care about that thing and are part of the audience you are trying to reach. You will be able to understand and connect with your customers even easier. If you aren’t, then customer interviews become the main way to ‘get into your customer’s head’.

Onward and Upward,

Josiah
