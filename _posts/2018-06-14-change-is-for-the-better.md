Rejection is scary for 2 reasons: 

1. We are afraid we are in adequate and becoming adequate will require change.
2. We are afraid of not being liked. 

I think everything falls under these 2 categories. Let’s take a look at the first one today: 

### Becoming Adequate Will Require Change
I was listening to Seth Godin’s Akimbo podcast recently. Seth was talking about challenging ourselves and our children (aka in schools) to solve problems that have no clear answer. 

We tend to only teach things we _know_ rather than things we don’t know. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense…how could we teach something that we don’t know? Seth points out that this leads to people being taught _what to think_ as opposed to _how to think_. Learning how to think and creatively come up with new ideas and solutions is hard. 

Most of us want fast solutions. The grind and patience necessary to creatively come up with something new doesn’t fit our culture today. And when you add the possibility of failure along the way, It only makes it scarier.

**But**, to get anywhere you it will be a grind and you must be ready and even embrace failure as we learn and grow. In the end, many small failures will lead to a great success.

Onward and Upward, 

Josiah
