## 

Sometimes you say you are gonna do something, but after a couple days or maybe a week, we lose momentum. We didn’t stick with it long enough to become habit, or to see results. 

_“I am going to eat better…”_

_”I am going to work out everyday…”_

_”I am going to read for 30 min before bed…”_

If you are anything like me, you do this with tasks in your business too. 

_”I am going to research more…network more…stay on top of admin duties…”_, the list goes on and on.

Well, today marks one month of sending out daily (every weekday) emails to my list talking about why I believe interviewing customers is so valuable and ecommerce in general. Some days have been a struggle, not gonna lie. Mostly it was just about setting aside the time to sit down and write something, rather than not knowing what to write about. Nonetheless, I have been proud to set out with a goal and stick to it. 

What is one thing you need to schedule time for and begin implementing consistently in your business. I encourage you to go add it to your calendar now and start your streak!

Onward!
