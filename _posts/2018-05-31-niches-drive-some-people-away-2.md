Part of knowing your niche is knowing where to find your customers. You know where they get their information, how you can get in front of them, and possibly how to become an authority to them. 

If someone buys from you who isn’t in your niche, you aren’t throwing their money back to them. They can still buy from you. 

You are instead trying to connect the dots between a problem your customer has and how your product will solve it for them. Instead of your marketing being about your product’s features, it shifts to being about the _better tomorrow_ it will bring your customers. 

**If you try speaking to everybody, you end up not speaking to anybody.**

Onward and Upward,
