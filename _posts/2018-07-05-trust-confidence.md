<p>In my research on why we trust people, I came across <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-cultures/201706/who-do-you-trust">this article. </a></p>

<p>I like how the article points out the word ‘trust’ and ‘confidence’ were used interchangeably in the Old English, as I think in our context, this is how I am using it. A customer being confident in buying from your store. </p>

<p>Take a minute and read the article, its about a 5 minutes.</p>
