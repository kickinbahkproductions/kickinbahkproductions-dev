We talked last week about the Shopify Unite keynote and some of the technology I am excited for. 

Today, I want to point you to a video from one of the big names in the Shopify space, Kurt Elster. He put out a _recap_ video of his takeaway’s from Unite and the general direction of Shopify. 

Kurt often says, “People don’t buy from brands, they buy from other people.” I resonate with this because we often get so stuck on making a great brand that we forget to be human.

You can find the video here on the [Ethercycle blog](https://ethercycle.com/blog/437). Let me know if anything specific stand out to you.
