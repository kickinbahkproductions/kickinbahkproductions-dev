I don’t discriminate when chocolate is involved. It is definitely one of my favorites.

For Mother’s Day, my wife and I were in charge of dessert and we picked up a cake from [Nothing Bundt Cakes](https://www.nothingbundtcakes.com/). Of course we went with the [Chocolate Chocolate Chip](https://www.nothingbundtcakes.com/flavors)…cuz yeah, chocolate. Because we weren’t sure about the size or if everyone would want to try it, we also got a pie from Cocos. Suffice to say, the bundt cake was a hit and only one person didn’t have any and chose the pie instead. Many came for seconds!

Tomorrow is National Chocolate Chip day, so if your sugar coma has worn off, go get yourself a nice chocolate chip cookie.

Each month has these fun and funny _holiday’s_ which may apply to your store at varying levels. They are lighthearted, bring a little whimsy, and are an awesome way to connect with people visiting your store or can be an excuse to email your list. 

A simple change of your store’s main image, creating a specific bundle or just a quirky email are phenomenal ways to engage, delight, and bring a smile to your customer’s day. 

If chocolate chips aren’t your thing or you can’t find any way to tie it into your store, here are a couple other ones coming up: 

May 17 - National Pack Rat Day
May 18 - National Bike to Work Day
May 19 - National Armed Forces Day
May 22 - Buy a Musical Instrument Day 
May 25 - National Wine Day
May 26 - International Jazz Day
May 31 - National Macaroon Day

Between Mother’s Day and Memorial Day, you might be choc full (see what I did there) of customer engagement ideas. But come the doldrums of August, take a gander at some of the quirky little holidays to keep entertaining your customers and stay top of mind.

Onward and Upward,

Josiah
