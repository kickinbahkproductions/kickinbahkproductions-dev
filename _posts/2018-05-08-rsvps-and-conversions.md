RSVPs are funny. When you receive one, they have a ton of pressure built into them.

For example, receiving a wedding invitation...it probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard about it. Save the dates usually went out a couple months before, you probably saw updates on social media, and you may have even had a conversation with the friend/family member getting married.

So why do RSVPs 'convert' so poorly?

When I receive an invitation to something, my first questions are:

Can I make it? Do I 'have' to make it? Can my wife can make it or should I just go alone? Oh and should I get the chicken or fish? 

I can barely figure out what is for dinner the today, much less 6 weeks away.

I have no desire to change the RSVP industry, so lets bring it to ecommerce…

Are you making your customer's think too much?

Discovering customer pains is often as simple as talking to them. Interviewing your customers is often a great way to find out stresses leading to less checkouts.
