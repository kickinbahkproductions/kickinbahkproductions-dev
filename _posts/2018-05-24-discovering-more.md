Another benefit of talking to your customers is knowing where to find _more like them_.  This is most helpful when you have a niche, but we will talk more about that at another time. 

Even without a specific niche, you can begin to understand what drives your customers and the issues they care about day to day. You can use this knowledge to create copy on your store that relates better, product descriptions that speak to their problems, and better targeted ads. 

All of these benefits available to you, you just have to take the step to ask. 

Onward and upward,
