Yesterday, we talked about the reaction I had to our recent change of moving. 

Have you ever made a change only to look back and realize you didn’t have it so bad before? 

This is one of my wife’s big concerns with changes she makes.
She thinks more about what is the ‘right’ choice and we will have conversations about the pros and cons of why we made a decision. We often will then revisit the decision again discuss whether those reasons are valid enough to continue making this change. 

A weakness to this type of thinking can be analysis paralysis. You try to account for every scenario that you end up stuck like a moth in a spider’s web. 

Onward and upward, 

Josiah
