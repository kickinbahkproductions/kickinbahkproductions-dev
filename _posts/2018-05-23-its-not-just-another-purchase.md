I think businesses are missing opportunities if they are not talking with their customers on a regular basis. Yeah, you probably knew that. I tend to be pretty vocal about it and if you have followed me for any amount of time, you have heard me say something along those lines.

Why does it matter though? What is lost? 

Simon Sinek says this: “Most businesses have either no clue or flawed assumptions to why their customers are their customers”. Are assumptions enough to get _close to the mark_?

Yes, well maybe….if you are right. 

My wife _LOVES_ it when I assume the next thing she is going to say. \*\*_spoken with dripping sarcasm_\*\* 

In reality, the problem with assuming is that we _suck_ at it. It may not matter if  I am completely off base with my wife’s next statement (though she might disagree), but basing a company strategy on assumptions? That will cost me.

Maybe money, maybe not. But it can also cost time and lost opportunities. So find out what your customer’s really think, what they really want, and why they really buy. 

Don’t assume. You know what that does. 

Onward and Upward,
