I was listening to Seth Godin’s Akimbo podcast the other day. (_Sidenote: I really like that podcast. He talks a lot about ways of thinking as opposed to specific tactics or strategies, but he usually removes it from our normal analogies to make it very fresh and with new perspective_.) He mentioned that the average toddler hears the word ‘no’ more than 400 times a day. They will keep hearing no till they eventually get a ‘yes’. 

I thought this was quite fitting considering what I have been talking about this week. When we are kids, we are much more willing to be rejected and hear ‘no’. As we get older, rejection becomes something we avoid at all costs. 

It is important to know when we need to return to the toddler mindset and be willing to hear a ‘no’ every now and then.
