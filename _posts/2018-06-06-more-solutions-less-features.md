Talking to your customers can help you create better product descriptions. 

I was looking at a store recently, [Tens](https://tens.co/). They sell sunglasses. 

The product description for [one of their sunglasses styles](https://tens.co/collections/sunglasses/products/ashton-sunglasses?variant=8705980072053) is, _“Serious business, without the serious. New for 2018, Ashton has all the edge, but it sure ain’t square… “_. 

I love this description. It isn’t a feature list. Those are on the page too, you just have to scroll down. But what you first see is the benefits. The way this pair of sunglasses will make life better if you wear them as opposed to others. 

Understanding these benefits is a great result of doing customer interviews. 

Onward and upward,
