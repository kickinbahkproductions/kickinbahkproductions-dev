People are so adverse to being sold to these days. It is fascinating to me. I am not to sure where exactly it stems from. If I had to take a guess, it is left over from the car salesman days where we thought we were convinced into buying something not worth the value we paid for it. 

That is just my guess. We don’t want to be the sucker in the deal. 

But with customer interviews, you aren’t looking to make a deal, just talk to your customer about how they felt after buying from you. No one is the loser in the situation because the transaction is with someone who already has trust in you and your brand.
